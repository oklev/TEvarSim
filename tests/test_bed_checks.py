"""
Tests for the ordering and overlap checks Simulate applies to its BED.

Both checks existed but never fired: the variables they compared against were initialised
once and never updated, so every event was measured against -1 and passed. An unsorted or
overlapping BED was therefore built into genomes in silence, and the genomes were wrong --
generate_genome walks a contig's events with a single forward cursor, so an event that
starts before the previous one ends sends that cursor backwards and duplicates sequence.

The checks are per contig, because that is the scope generate_genome works in. A BED sorted
by contig and then by position -- which is what TErandom writes -- must pass.

No external test runner is required::

    PYTHONPATH=. python tests/test_bed_checks.py

The test functions are also discoverable by pytest.
