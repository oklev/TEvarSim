"""
Tests for the HTML report ``tevarsim Evaluate`` writes.

The report exists because the summary cannot show a *shape*: a mean and an SD of the
breakpoint error do not separate a caller that is exact everywhere but badly wrong twice
from one that jitters a base either way on every locus. The tests below pin the things
that make the figures readable rather than merely present -- an exact call getting a bar
of its own, an axis that stays symmetric so a bias cannot hide, the outcome segments
partitioning the simulated distribution instead of double-counting it -- and the two
properties that make the page usable where these simulations actually run: it opens
offline, and it degrades rather than lies when the prediction carries no genotypes.

No external test runner is required::

    PYTHONPATH=. python tests/test_report.py

The test functions are also discoverable by pytest.
