'''
``tevarsim Evaluate`` -- the HTML report.

``Evaluate`` prints a fixed-width summary and writes the same numbers to JSON. Both are
faithful and neither shows a *distribution*: "breakpoint offset: mean +0.07 bp, SD 0.60 bp"
cannot distinguish a caller that is exact on every locus but 30bp out on two of them from
one that scatters a bp either side of the truth on all of them. Those are different
problems, and the shape that separates them is a histogram of the per-locus errors -- the
figure the Tangram paper (Wu et al. 2014, BMC Genomics 15:795, Figure 2) reports breakpoint
resolution with, and Figure 1's overlay of the missed events on the simulated size
distribution for detection.

So this module renders the per-locus records ``Evaluate`` already computes as one
self-contained HTML page:

  * the signed breakpoint error of every correctly placed call, as a histogram, plus the
    cumulative "exact / within N bp" readout,
  * the signed allele length error, the same way,
  * the simulated event sizes, with each size's loci stacked by what became of them, so a
    sensitivity floor at a particular element size is visible rather than averaged away,
  * and the existing strata (event type, family, size, allele frequency, carriers) as
    grouped bars beside the tables the text report prints.

Everything is generated here: the charts are inline SVG built from Python, so the page
needs no plotting library at run time and no network at read time. That matters because
these reports are read wherever the simulation ran -- over a mounted filesystem, or copied
off a cluster -- and a chart that fetches a script from a CDN is a blank box there. One
file, opened in any browser, offline.

The palette is the validated default categorical/ordinal set: it clears the colour-vision
separation, chroma and contrast gates in both light and dark mode. Do not substitute
colours here by eye -- an outcome stack in green/amber/red, the obvious choice, fails
deuteranopia separation outright (dE 4.1 against a floor of 8).
