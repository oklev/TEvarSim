'''
``tevarsim Evaluate`` -- score a prediction against every simulated event at once.

``Compare`` answers "how well was *this* genome called?". It takes one truth sample and one
prediction sample and reports site-level precision/recall plus a genotype accuracy for that
pair, so benchmarking a whole simulation means looping it over every genome and stitching
the per-genome outputs back together by hand.

``Evaluate`` turns the question around. The unit of analysis is the simulated *event*, not
the genome: each record in the truth VCF is one event, and each event is scored once,
against all of the simulated genomes at the same time. Truth and prediction samples are
paired by name (the pairing ``Compare`` is normally driven with, ``-I $sample -J $sample``),
so no genome has to be named on the command line. Each event then carries

  * whether the prediction recovered the locus at all, and how far off its breakpoint and
    allele length were,
  * which genomes were called as carriers versus which genomes actually carry it, and
  * whether the genotype of each paired genome agrees by allele content,

and those per-event records are aggregated into overall metrics plus breakdowns by event
type, TE family, event size and allele frequency.

Allele comparison, family parsing and the confusion-count arithmetic are shared with
``Compare`` so the two subcommands agree on what "the same allele" means.
